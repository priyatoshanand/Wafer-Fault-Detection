# Wafer-Fault-Detection


This is a binary classification project where we built a pipeline to the check the quality
of Wafer Sensors based on the data provided by client and predict which Wafer Sensor is faulty.

Data Description

The client will send data in multiple sets of files in batches at a given location. Data will contain Wafer names and 590 columns of different sensor values for each wafer. The last column will have the "Good/Bad" value for each wafer.
"Good/Bad" column will have two unique values +1 and -1.  
"+1" represents Bad wafer.
"-1" represents Good Wafer.
